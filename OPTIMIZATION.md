# Brainly LCP Optimization Guide

This document outlines the optimizations implemented to improve the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) performance of the Brainly application.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Font Loading Optimization
- Reduced font weights to only those used (400, 500, 600, 700)
- Added `font-display: swap` to ensure text remains visible during font loading
- Added preconnect to Google Fonts domain

### 2. Component Lazy Loading
- Implemented React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting
- Created LoadingFallback component that appears during lazy loading
- Deferred non-critical component rendering with DeferredLoad component

### 3. Image Optimization
- Created OptimizedImage component for better image loading
- Implemented progressive loading with placeholders
- Prioritized above-the-fold images with eager loading

### 4. Build Optimizations
- Configured Vite for optimal chunking (vendor, UI libraries)
- Added compression plugins (Gzip, Brotli)
- Implemented image optimization with vite-plugin-imagemin
- Disabled CSS code splitting for faster initial load

### 5. Critical Rendering Path
- Removed initial animations from hero section
- Deferred non-critical animations to improve LCP
- Used requestIdleCallback for non-critical initialization

### 6. Resource Hints
- Added preload directives for critical resources
- Added preconnect for external resources
- Added appropriate meta tags for performance

## Monitoring and Analysis

To analyze bundle size and performance:
```
npm run analyze
```

This will generate a visualization of the bundle size and help identify further optimization opportunities.

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider implementing a service worker for caching
2. Use HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections
3. Implement server-side rendering for critical content
4. Consider using a CDN for static assets
5. Optimize third-party script loading with async/defer attributes
